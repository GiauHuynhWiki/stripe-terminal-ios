/**
 The updated payment intent after a confirm request errors.

 If this value is nil, the request timed out, and the status of the payment
 intent is unknown. We recommend that you retry confirming the original
 payment intent. If you instead choose to abandon the original payment intent
 and instead create a new one, you should be sure not to capture the original
 payment intent. You may also want to reconcile payment intents with your
 internal orders system to clean up any dangling authorizations.

 If the status of the updated payment intent is still `RequiresConfirmation`
 (e.g the request failed because your app is not connected to the internet),
 you may call `confirmPaymentIntent` again with the updated payment intent to
 retry the request.

 If the status of the updated payment intent is now `RequiresSource` (e.g. the
 request failed because the card was declined), you should call `attachSource`
 with the updated payment intent to try charging another card.

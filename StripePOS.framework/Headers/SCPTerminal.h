 The Point of Sale SDK is modeled as a set of commands you can issue to an
 instance of SCPTerminal. These commands let you discover card readers, connect
 to a specific reader, and initiate actions on the reader.

 Asynchronous commands end with a completion parameter, called after the command
 completes with the result of the command.

 If the asynchronous command can be canceled, the command will return an
 optional `SCPCancelable` object. If this object is non-nil, the command was
 successfully started. You can request to stop the command by calling `cancel`
 on the returned object.

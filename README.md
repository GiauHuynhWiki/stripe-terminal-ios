# Stripe Terminal iOS SDK

## Requirements
The Stripe Terminal iOS SDK is compatible with apps supporting iOS 10 and above.

## Running the example app
- Run `setup.sh` to install required dependencies
- In `RootViewController.swift`, set your Stripe Account's test secret API key. A backend simulator has been included as part of the example app for demonstration purposes only. Note that you should _never_ store your Stripe account's secret API key in your own app. For more information, see https://stripe.com/docs/keys

# stripe-pos-ios

During the private alpha program, the iOS Point of Sale SDK will only be available for download as a zipped release package. You can find the latest alpha release of SDK on the [Releases page](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-pos-ios/releases). (After the alpha phase has ended, we'll make the SDK available via the usual channels, Cocoapods and Carthage.)

The zipped release package contains:

- The iOS framework
- An example app (open Example/Example.xcodeproj)
- API reference docs (open docs/index.html)
- A changelog, which you can use to get started updating your integration from a previous version.

After downloading the release package, you can start by running the Example app, connecting to a reader, and creating a payment using one of our provided test cards.

To start integrating your own app, follow our integration guide at https://stripe.com/docs/point-of-sale

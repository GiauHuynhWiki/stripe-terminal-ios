 Before integrating the SDK, you should create an endpoint on your backend
 that creates a new Point of Sale activation token via the Stripe API.
 The SDK will request a new activation token from this endpoint whenever your
 app connects to a reader.

 We suggest making your application's API client conform to this protocol.

 For more information, follow the integration guide at
 https://stripe.com/docs/point-of-sale

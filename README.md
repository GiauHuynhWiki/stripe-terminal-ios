# Stripe Terminal iOS SDK

https://stripe.com/terminal

## Requirements
The Stripe Terminal iOS SDK is compatible with apps supporting iOS 10 and above.

## Try the example app
- Navigate to the `Example` folder, and open `Example.xcodeproj`.
- In `RootViewController.swift`, set your Stripe Account's test secret API key. A backend simulator has been included as part of the example app for demonstration purposes only. Note that you should _never_ store your Stripe account's secret API key in your own app. For more information, see https://stripe.com/docs/keys
- Note: the example app comes with the Stripe Terminal SDK pre-installed, but uses a few other dependencies. We've included pre-built dependencies using Swift 4.2. You may need to run `./setup.sh` to re-build the app's dependencies for your environment.

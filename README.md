# Stripe Terminal iOS SDK

## Requirements
The Stripe Terminal iOS SDK is compatible with apps supporting iOS 10 and above.

## Running the example app
- Run `setup.sh` to install required dependencies
- In `RootViewController.swift`, set your Stripe Account's test secret key. Note that this is for demonstration purposes only. You should _never_ store your account's secret API key in your app. For more information, see https://stripe.com/docs/keys
